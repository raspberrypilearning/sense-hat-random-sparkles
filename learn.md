By creating random sparkles with your Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT you will learn:

- How to use the Python library for the Sense HAT, the hardware used by Tim Peake on the International Space Station
- How to use the Sense HAT library's `set_pixel` function to place a pixel of a specific colour on a specific place on the display
- How to use the random module's `randint` function to generate random integers in a given range
- How to use a `while` loop to repeat a set of instructions forever
- How to use `sleep` to pause a program for a given amount of time

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)
- [Use basic digital, analogue, and electromechanical components](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/creator)
