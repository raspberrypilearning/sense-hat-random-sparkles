## Connect to your Sense HAT

+ If you have a Sense HAT, attach it to your Raspberry Pi.

[[[rpi-sensehat-attach]]]

+ If you do not have a Sense HAT, you could create the project using the Sense HAT emulator.

[[[rpi-sensehat-emulator]]]


**Note:** if you are using a Sense HAT, you will be using Thonny for your code. If you are using the Sense HAT emulator, you will be using Trinket. Depending on which option you are using, there may be some differences in the colour of the text highlighting.
