## What you will need

### Hardware

* A Raspberry Pi
* A Sense HAT (If you do not have a Sense HAT, you can create the project using the Sense HAT emulator in a [web browser](https://trinket.io/sense-hat) or on the Raspbian OS.)

### Software
You will need the [latest version of Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/), which already includes the following software packages:

- Python 3
- Sense HAT for Python 3

If for any reason you need to install a package manually, follow these instructions:

[[[rpi-install-software]]]

Type this command into a terminal window to install the Sense HAT package:

```bash
sudo apt-get install sense-hat
```
