## What you will need

### Hardware

* A Raspberry Pi
* A Sense HAT (If you do not have a Sense HAT, you could create the project in a web browser using the [Sense HAT emulator](https://trinket.io/sense-hat).)

### Software
You will need the [latest version of Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) which already includes the following software packages:

- Python 3
- Sense HAT for Python 3

If for any reason you need to install a package manually, follow these instructions:

[[[rpi-install-software]]]

Type this command into the terminal to install the Sense HAT package:

```bash
sudo apt-get install sense-hat
```
