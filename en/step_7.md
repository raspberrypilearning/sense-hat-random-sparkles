## What next?

- Try reducing your `sleep` down to `0.01` so it runs faster
- Try removing the `sleep` line so there's no delay at all
- Try limiting the colour numbers to `randint(100, 255)` to reduce the intensity of the colours
- Try fixing one of the colour values to `0` to bias the colour mix - for example, `r, g, 0` will only make red/green/yellow colours
- What else can you draw on your Sense HAT display? Try making an [animated Pixel Pet](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/pixel-pet/)!
