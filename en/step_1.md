## What you will make
In this resource, you will use Python to control the Sense HAT's LED display, and learn how to set specific coloured pixels on it. You will learn how to generate random numbers to choose random positions and colour values, and place them on the display continuously to create an amazing effect called random sparkles.

## What you will learn
By creating random sparkles with your Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT you will learn:

- How to use the Python library for the Sense HAT, the hardware used by Tim Peake on the International Space Station
- How to use the Sense HAT library's `set_pixel` function to place a pixel of a specific colour on a specific place on the display
- How to use the random module's `randint` function to generate random integers in a given range
- How to use a `while` loop to repeat a set of instructions forever
- How to use `sleep` to pause a program for a given amount of time

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)
- [Use basic digital, analogue, and electromechanical components](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/creator)
